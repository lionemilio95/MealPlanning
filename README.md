# MealPlanning
This is a project which uses Web Scrapping, Stochastic programming, Linear Programming and Python to optimize a meal planning for the user. I am mainly responsible for the data scrapping part.
The main purpose of this project is to make a 5-day meal recipe for two users. We would make the meal plan according to their daily requirements for nutrition, constraints of cooking time, budgets, and the ratings for the meal recipes. 
Therefore, the objective function is to maximize the sum of ratings from two users for all recipes being selected and minimize their discrepancy between their total cooking time.
We use the following formula and linear equations to optimize the meal recipe:
